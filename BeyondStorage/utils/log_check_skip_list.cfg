# ModLogger Verbosity Check - Skip List
# 
# This file contains a list of C# files to skip when checking for unwrapped ModLogger calls.
# Each line should contain a file path relative to the Source directory.
# Lines starting with # are treated as comments and ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# Examples:
# Infrastructure/ModLogger.cs
# Tests/TestLogger.cs
# External/ThirdPartyCode.cs
#
# Use forward slashes (/) or backslashes (\) - both will work on all platforms.
#
# Files to skip:

# Example: Skip the ModLogger class itself since it's expected to have unwrapped calls
